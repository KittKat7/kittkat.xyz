		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		Welcome to my website! My name is kittkat and this website is my personal space to showcase the projects I have
		been
		working on. As a developer, I have always been passionate about creating new tools and applications that can
		simplify
		people's lives. This website is the perfect platform for me to share my creations with the world and allow
		people to
		benefit from the tools I have developed.

		I have a variety of apps that I host on this website. You can find all the information about my apps on the
		dedicated
		'Apps' page. I hope that you find my apps useful and if you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to get
		in
		touch
		with me. Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring all the tools I have to offer.

					I have two cats, and one dog. I love all three, but I am more of a cat person. I will often theme my
					projects around cats. I like the outdoors and the mountains, and enjoy hiking.
					I am a college student, majoring in Computer Science, and minoring in Americal Sign Language. I do
					my
					best
					to keep on top of school and work, and hold myself to a high accademic and professional standard. In
					my
					free
					time, I will spend some time playing videogames. If I am not gaming, I will often spend my time
					working
					on
					coding projects. Through these projects, I have learned most of what I know about programming.
					I have programming skills in Java, Python, Flutter (and dart), limited MySQL, and limited web
					languages
					(HTML PHP CSS JavaScript).
					I am a member of the Appalachian State Robotics Club, where I helped write the driving / controller
					code
					for
					the current rover test platform. Currently I am serving as the Programming Team leader, and help
					with
					other
					leadership possitions inside the club.
