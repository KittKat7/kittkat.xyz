			<p>
				Deep in the forest lurks a dangerous beast which feeds off of the flesh of unsuspecting travelers, the
				wendigo. The wendigo romes the forest, from village to village, hunting the villagers until no one
				remains, then moving on. If your village has the misfortune of being found by the wendigo, your best
				hope is to abandon the village and find somewhere else to live. Algonquin legend has it that the wendigo
				was formed from greed and jealousy, and now romes the forest, always on the hunt, never getting enough.
			</p>
			<p>
				You play as Itawi, an Algonquin boy whose village is being hunted by the wendigo. To save your village,
				you must defeat the wendigo, however, this will not be easy. You must venture into the forest -- the
				home of the wendigo -- and come out alive on the other side. The village is counting on you.

			<h2>Game Concept</h2>

			<p>
				The Wendigo is an Algonquin legend of a fearsome creature who terrorizes villages. Created by the greed
				of people, the Wendigo hunts down villagers and eats them. Never getting enough, the Wendigo will lurk
				outside the village, preying on the inhabitants, until the village is gone and it moves on to its next
				target.
				You will play as an Algonquin boy whose village is under threat by a wendigo. You must brave the danger
				and venture into the woods in order to find the Wendigo's weakness and save your village.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h3>Protagonist: Itawi.</h3>
			He is a normal boy from an Algonquin village. No special characteristics, except he
			is very determined.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h3>Antagonist: Wendigo.</h3>
			A powerful creature that inhabits the woods, and eats the villagers.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h3>Conflict.</h3>
			One day, a hunting party does not come back to the village. The villagers determine there is a
			wendigo which is attacking the hunters. The villagers devise a plan, but they need a volunteer. The boy
			volunteers to help stop the wendigo.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h3>Culture.</h3>
			The story of the Wendigo originated from the Native American Algonquin people. There is evidence to suggest
			that these people arrived in North Carolina between 9500 B.C. and 8000 B.C.The Algonquin were not only
			hunter gatherers, they also cultivated some of their food as well. The Algonquin stretched from the
			Carolinas up into parts of Canada. Their houses were often covered with bark.
			The Wendigo is a monster from algonquin folklore. It is depicted in multiple different ways, ranging from an
			evil spirit possessing humans, to a hideous monster. This creature is seen as the embodiment of negative
			characteristics such as greed.

				The Forest Hunts only covers defeating the wendigo. To extend this story, I will be releasing a

			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				Hi! My name is Avery, but I go by KittKat online. I am the developer behind this project. I am, at the
				time
				of writing this, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in American Sign Language at Appalachian
				State
				University. I enjoy computer programming, and spend much of my free time working on developing apps. If
				you
				want to check out my other projects, you can go the the Apps section on my website!
			</p>
			<p>
				This website was created for one of my App State classes, MTL2010 "NARRATIVE, NEW MEDIA & GAMING",
				Spring
				2024. The goal of this project was to create a game concept based on a cultural story, then use a
				website to
				present this game concept. I chose the story of the wendigo for my project. I first head this story at a
				summer camp that I used to attend. That camp has been a very influential part of my life, and the story
				of
				the wendigo has stuck with me. I even created my own variation of the story, which I told at the camp
				(and
				maybe it will be in a sequal game).
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond the sentimental relation to summer camp, I feel there is a deeper meaning to this story, which
				still
				has relevence today. The way I know the wendigo story, the wendigo is essentially the embodyment of
				greed,
				which causes devistating destruction. Thinking about that in terms of modern society, we take what we
				want
				without regard for its affect on the enviroment. In a way, I think the consequences of this, global
				warming,
				shortage of resources, increasingly unstable enviroment, can be thought of as a form of the wendigo.
