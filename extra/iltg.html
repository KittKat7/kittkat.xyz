			<h1>I Lost the Game</h1>
			<div class="pars">
			<p>
				The Game, oh how elusive,
				<br>
				An endless loop of thought intrusive.
				<br>
				It creeps in when you least expect,
				<br>
				And once you're caught, you can't neglect.
				<br><br>
				The rules are simple, yet profound,
				<br>
				Don't think of it, don't make a sound.
				<br>
				For once you do, you must admit,
				<br>
				You've lost the game, you can't outwit.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's played by many, far and wide,
				<br>
				A mental game that's hard to hide.
				<br>
				It brings a smile, a laugh, a sigh,
				<br>
				And unites us, no matter why.
				<br><br>
				So let us play, and play it well,
				<br>
				A game that words alone can't tell.
				<br>
				For though we'll lose, we'll all agree,
				<br>
				The Game's the best of company.
