		<h3>ASpeLl (as fingerspelled above)</h3>
		<h3>ABOUT ASPELL</h3>
		ASpeLl is an open-source app designed to help students who are learning Americal Sign Language (ASL) practice
		their fingerspelling skills. Fingerspelling is a method of communicating by spelling words using the ASL signs
		for the English alphabet to compose words. This app is not designed to replace an actual class with a qualified
		teacher, but to help as an extra source of practice.
		<br>
		<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
		Avery is a college student at Appalachian State University studying a major in computer science and a minor in
		Americal Sign Language. Avery, when encountered with a problem, often attempts to make a computer program to
		help solve the problem. In this case, the problem is they haven't done any signing in at least a year, and they
		are enrolled in an ASL 3 class. To practice their signing they turned to sites like asl.ms This site is an
		amazing resource but is not optimized to work well on a mobile device. This got annoying to Avery, so they set
		out to make their own version, hence, ASpeLl.
		<br>
		<h3>TECHNICAL INFO</h3>
		This is an open-source project, go check out the code! (https://github.com/KittKat7/ASpeLl). This app is
		programmed in the flutter framework (using dart as its language). The reason for flutter was to write the source
		code only once and have it be able to run on most common devices, IE: Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, IOS, and
		Web.

		<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
		No user data is collected or shared inside the app.
