				CURRENT RELEASE VERSION

			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				The second generation of these keycaps. These are tapered, improving the look and feel. There are also
				keycaps for the slightly wider ctrl, alt, and meta keys, and there is a spacebar key aswell. There are
				also versions of the keycaps that have letters inset in the caps. The letters are in the JetBrains Mono
				Space Font - which is my favorite font for coding, infact, its the font I am using while coding this
				webpage.
			</p>
			<h3>Supported Keys</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Blank</li>
				<li>Letters</li>
				<li>Numbers</li>
				<li>Hex shape (for modifiers)</li>
				<li>Space bar (only confirmed support for Keychron K (not pro) series)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Processing</h3>
			<p>
				A few ideas: For the flat cap, you could paint the letters onto it; For the inset cap, you can paint it,
				then sand the paint outside of the inset, or you could use a 3d pen to draw the letter inside in a
				different color; or 3D print the letter and glue it in.
				If you want something more complex, you can print the letter in one color, then print the cap on top of
				it, this is what I did for the second from the right in the first picture. This is really nice, but is a
				hastle to do, and has a high fail rate.

				NO LONGER UPDATED
			</p>
			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>
				This was the first designed version of the keycaps. They are a box, litterally. The only cap designed is
				for a 1U (normal) keycap. There is no design for any other caps, including space, backspace, shift,
				enter, etc... There are also no legends on the caps. Legends can be painted on the cap is desired.
			</p>
			<h3>Supported Keys</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Blank</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Processing</h3>
			<p>
				Since there are no legends on these keycaps, you may want to add some. This can be done by manually
				painting onto the keycap. If you are feeling really adventurous, you can 3d print flat letters and glue
				them on or use a 3d pen to draw the letters directly onto the cap. However, these two methods will
				result in the letter being raised which may not be desirable.
