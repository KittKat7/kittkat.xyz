		<h2 class="h2-banner">About</h2>

		<a href="https://github.com/KittKat7/SystemSolve" class="btn">GitHub</a>

		<h3>Goals</h3>

		<p>
			Make a fun game which teaches basic coding concepts to anyone who has no previous experience, but wants to
			learn. This project was originally created as a final project for App State Software Engineering (CS3667).

		<h3>Comments</h3>

		Comments allow for leaving notes in the code without affecting the code. Any line that starts with
		<code>#</code> will be ignored as code, and will not be run. This means that <code># moveU</code> will not run.
		Allowing us to add documentation into our code without affecting how it runs.

		<h4>Example</h4>

		<pre><code>
# In this case, we can say what the code is doing without interupting the code.
# This code will move the character up three times
moveU
moveU
moveU
			</code></pre>
		</p>
		<!--
			== Movement
		-->
		<p>
		<h3>Movement Components</h3>

		Controls the movement of the character.
		<br>
		Every time one of these Components is run, the character will attempt to move in the designated direction.

		<h4>Components</h4>

		<code>moveU</code> Move the character one tile up
		<br>
		<code>moveD</code> Move the character one tile down
		<br>
		<code>moveL</code> Move the character one tile left
		<br>
		<code>moveR</code> Move the player one tile right

		<h4>Example</h4>

		<pre><code>
# Move the character up twice, then left twice, then down once.
moveU
moveU
moveL
moveL
moveD
		</code></pre>
		</p>
		<!--
			== Conditions
		-->
		<p>
		<h3>Conditions</h3>

		A condition is a true or false value depending one some condition. These conditions are used in if statements
		and while loops to determine its behavior. If the condition for the if statement is true, then the if statement
		will run, otherwise the if's code will be skipped. If statements can also be negated by using <code>!</code> in
		front of the condition. For example <code>isOnGoal</code> is true if the player is on the goal, however
		<code>!isOnGoal</code> is true if the player is NOT on the goal.

		<h4>Components</h4>

		<code>true</code> Always true
		<br>
		<code>false</code> Always false, same as <code>!TRUE</code>
		<br>
		<code>canMoveU</code> Is true if the player can move up
		<br>
		<code>canMoveD</code> Is true if the player can move down
		<br>
		<code>canMoveL</code> Is true if the player can move left
		<br>
		<code>canMoveR</code> Is true if the player can move right
		<br>
		<code>isOnGoal</code> Is true if the character is on the goal, or the map has no goal.

		<h4>Example</h4>

		<pre><code>
# Move the character up only if the player can move up
if canMoveU:
	moveU
fi

# Move the character left if the plater CANNOT move right
if !canMoveR:
	moveL
fi
		</code></pre>

		</p>
		<!--
			== If Statements
		-->
		<p>
		<h3>If statements</h3>

		If statements control what code runs depenting on a given condition. For example, if you only want to mode left
		if you can move left. You could use an if statement to check if you can move left, and if so, run the code to
		move left.

		<h4>Components</h4>

		If statements are made of several different components.
		<br>
		<code>if</code> Signifies that this is an if statement
		<br>
		<code># CONDITION:</code> The condition in the if statement
		<br>
		<code>fi</code> Signifies the end of the if statement
		<br>
		<br>
		If statements are constructed:
		<pre><code>
# Begenning of if code (replace 'CONDITION' with the actual condition, but keep the ':')
if CONDITION:
	# code
	# code
	# code
# End of if code block
fi
		</code></pre>

		<h4>Example</h4>

		<pre><code>
if canMoveU:
	moveU
fi
		</code></pre>
		</p>
		<!--
			== While loops
		-->
		<p>
		<h3>While loops</h3>

		<h4>Components</h4>

		<h4>Example</h4>

		<pre><code>
while canMoveU:
	moveU
elihw
		</code></pre>
		</p>
